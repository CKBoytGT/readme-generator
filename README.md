# README Generator

A command-line application that dynamically generates a README file in Markdown format.

## Installation
You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. Clone the repo locally on your drive.
2. Navigate to the `team-profile-generator` directory in your CLI.
3. Install dependencies using `npm i`.

## Usage
1. While in the `team-profile-generator` directory in your CLI, type `node index` and press enter.
2. Enter the information requested by each prompt. Some prompts will open your default text editor so that you can enter multiple lines.
3. Once you have entered your filename, the Markdown file will be generated in the `output` directory.
